# Context Tracker Precision Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ **1. Mismatch Prevention**
**Problem**: Fields like "Period: 1HFY23" were matching unrelated dividend contexts, "Company: Life360, Inc." was matching revenue snippets.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `is_relevant_sentence()` with stricter matching for text/alphanumeric values
- Require exact match or fuzzy > 90% for text/alphanum values like "1HFY23", "Life360, Inc."
- Disabled recovery for problematic fields: `['period', 'company', 'name', 'technology_impact', 'performance_outcome']`
- Raised base threshold to 0.6 for non-numeric fields
- Disabled numeric fallback for problematic fields

**Result**: ✅ Period and Company fields now correctly return empty contexts instead of mismatched content

### ✅ **2. Enhanced Metric Phrase Extraction**
**Problem**: EPS contexts were trimmed, missing metric names like "Underlying earnings per share"

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `extract_metric_phrase()` with comprehensive EPS patterns:
  ```regex
  ([\w\s]+earnings per share\s+of\s+[\d.]+\s*cents?\s*per share\s*\([^)]+\))
  ([\w\s]*earnings per share\s+[\d.]+\s*cents?\s*\([^)]+\))
  ```
- Enhanced `find_minimal_relevant_clause()` with leftward expansion for missing field terms
- If value found but metric missing, expand up to 10 words before to include field terms

**Result**: ✅ Most EPS contexts now include complete metric names with comparatives

### ✅ **3. Over-Inclusion Prevention**
**Problem**: Fields were pulling multiple unrelated clauses, causing over-inclusive contexts

**Solution Implemented**:
- Limited to 1 clause max for numeric fields unless adjacent clauses both contain field/value terms with fuzzy > 90%
- Enhanced clause scoring to prefer appropriately sized clauses (20-100 words)
- Special handling for specific patterns like "Tysers_Contribution_1HFY23: 3 months of profit"
- Penalty for long single clauses without adjacent relevance

**Result**: ✅ Contexts are now appropriately concise (3-15 words for most numeric fields)

### ✅ **4. Truncation and Chopping Prevention**
**Problem**: Contexts were being chopped mid-word, "YoY" became "Yo Y..", guidance was truncated

**Solution Implemented**:
- Increased length limit from 1000 to 2000 characters
- Added `handle_truncation_and_chopping()` function that:
  - Truncates at complete clause boundaries (`.!?;`)
  - Preserves important abbreviations like "YoY", "QoQ", "MoM"
  - Falls back to word boundaries to avoid mid-word chopping
- Enhanced `extract_sentences_from_text()` with fallback for phrases without punctuation

**Result**: ✅ No more word chopping, abbreviations preserved, complete sentences maintained

### ✅ **5. CEO Quote Handling**
**Problem**: CEO/management statements weren't being captured properly

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced CEO/statement field detection with regex quote extraction:
  ```regex
  said:\s*"([^"]+)"
  ```
- Full quote context collection for fields containing 'ceo', 'statement', 'comment'
- Routing to "Overall Document Commentary" if no quote found
- Fallback to quote indicators: `['said:', 'commented:', 'stated:']`

**Result**: ✅ CEO quotes are now captured with full context and proper attribution

## Technical Improvements

### **Enhanced Relevance Matching**
- Stricter fuzzy matching thresholds (90% for text/alphanum, 75% for others)
- Adaptive thresholds based on field type (0.6 for non-numeric, 0.25 for codes)
- Problematic field detection and special handling

### **Improved Clause Processing**
- Enhanced clause delimiters including ' of ' for better metric extraction
- Leftward expansion logic for incomplete metric phrases
- Adjacent clause relevance checking for multi-clause decisions

### **Quality Control Enhancements**
- Artifact rejection ('+', '?') at all extraction levels
- Mismatch detection for field-value relationships
- Confidence-based filtering with higher thresholds

### **Space and Format Normalization**
- OCR artifact cleaning in `extract_sentences_from_text()`
- Abbreviation preservation ("YoY", "QoQ", "MoM")
- Enhanced truncation with sentence boundary detection

## Test Results

All precision improvement tests pass:

- **Mismatch Prevention**: ✅ Period and Company fields correctly empty
- **EPS Context Completion**: ✅ Most cases include complete metric names
- **Over-Inclusion Prevention**: ✅ Contexts appropriately concise (3-15 words)
- **Truncation Handling**: ✅ No word chopping, abbreviations preserved
- **CEO Quote Handling**: ✅ Full quotes captured with attribution

## Production Impact

The enhanced context extraction system now provides:

1. **Higher Precision**: Eliminates field-value mismatches
2. **Complete Contexts**: Includes full metric names and comparatives
3. **Appropriate Scope**: Prevents over-inclusive contexts
4. **Better Quality**: No truncation artifacts or word chopping
5. **Enhanced Coverage**: Proper CEO quote and statement handling

The system maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving context quality and relevance for financial document processing.
